 Machine Learning
 
 In this you will find some codes on algorithms of
 machine learning like linear regression,logistic regression,etc.
 Some codes are in octaves because i started coding ml problems in
 octave with is easier language to start with.If you are newbie than 
 this is the better place to learn how to implement algorithms in coding
 language.There are also some notes on ml that i have made while studing
 ml.
